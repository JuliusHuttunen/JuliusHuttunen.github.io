                    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio site!</h1>
                    <p>Hey there! I am a 24 years old business IT student from Helsinki. I'm studying at Haaga-Helia UAS
                        for my third year, finishing up my bachelor's studies.
                        In addition, I'm also taking part in Experis Academy Graduate program as a Java Full Stack
                        Developer.
                        <br><br>
                        I enjoy programming and creating visually pleasing
                        stuff.
                        That is exactly why Full Stack suits me so well.
                        <br><br>
                        My family consists of my wife, our two years old daughter and our little baby boy. I usually
                        spend my free time
                        with family and friends. We are an active family and enjoy taking
                        walks in nature and sometimes grabbing a few Geocaches on the way.
                        <br><br>
                        I consider music my main hobby, and I play guitar, ukulele and bass.
                        <br><br>
                        As I have a developer job that I enjoy, I am in no need of a job. However, this page serves
                        as a representation of the skills I have and would like to share with all of you!
